     Parallel version (MPI & OpenMP), running on     256 processor cores
     Number of MPI processes:               256
     Threads/MPI process:                     1

     MPI processes distributed on     8 nodes
     R & G space division:  proc/nbgrp/npool/nimage =     256

     Reading data from directory:
     ./graphene.save/

     IMPORTANT: XC functional enforced from input :
     Exchange-correlation      = PBE ( 1  4  3  4 0 0)
     Any further DFT definition will be discarded
     Please, verify this is what you really want
